        And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of
        these huge buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold
        leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the
        garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light
        cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at
        sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. You
        walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away
        the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in
        a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the
        face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the
        background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster,
        will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into
        flame.

        How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a
        mystery to me. But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were
        gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the
        nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty
        of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not
        merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value; for
        gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector.
        Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its
        reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination.
        Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its
        brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. This is why
        gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.

        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance
        from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the
        season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale,
        white glow scarcely varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the
        ribs seem strangely immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had
        become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this
        dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting
        my vision. The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the
        heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness,
        creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
        indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the
        light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in
        ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the
        ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of
        the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you
        should find you had grown old and gray?
