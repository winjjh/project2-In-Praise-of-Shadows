          We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples
          of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's
          treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are
          these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the
          outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of
          the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes,
          and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the
          combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of
          absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems
          rather to suit the painting perfectly.

            For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface
            upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely
            the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach
            such importance to age and patina. A new painting, even one done in
            ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows of
            an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care. A Japanese
            room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled
            shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove
            where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built
            Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of
            shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of
            the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is
            marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn
            into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more.
            And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the
            crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we
            know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the
            feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns
            complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable
            tranquility holds sway.

            feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an
            alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the
            key to this mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were
            the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that
            instant revert to mere void. An empty space is

            This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light
            from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that
            formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any
            wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no
            means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what
            extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the
            placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the
            crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most
            exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study
            bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.
            For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface
            upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely
