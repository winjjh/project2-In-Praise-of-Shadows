        This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from
        this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there
        a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or
        ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply
        achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains
        were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the
        shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the
        threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of
        the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the
        passage of time.

        The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window
        built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be
        regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; but most
        often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the
        sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels. There
        is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these
        panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way
        beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by then lost its power
        to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life. It can do no
        more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I sometimes linger
        before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, but
        giving no impression of brilliance.

      <div class="apprent-three">
        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance
        from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the
        season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale,
        white glow scarcely varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the
        ribs seem strangely immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had
        become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this
        dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting
        my vision. The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the
        heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness,
        creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
        indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the
        light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in
        ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the
        ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of
        the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you
        should find you had grown old and gray?
